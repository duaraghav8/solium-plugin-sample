# solium-plugin-sample
Sample Solium Plugin. Also serves as the entry point for any solium plugin developer.

- Clone this repository. `cd` to it.
- Run `npm install --dev` to install both the dependencies and devDependencies.
- Now run `npm test` to ensure that tests are running fine. If any tests are failing but the repo's build status is `successful`, please report the issue.
You're now ready to develop your plugin from the sample :)
